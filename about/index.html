                About This Website
            </h2>
            <p>
                This is my personal homepage which hosts my RPG game. Though the RPG game is a cringe fest right now, I will improve it over the course
                of time.
                The website is currently written in vanilla HTML CSS, but I will use Bootstrap to improve the styling later on. I
                am also considering using other frameworks for routing.

                About 124san
            </h2>
            <p>
                I am Daniel "124san" Kong from China, and I am currently living and studying in Canada. As of April 2019 I am a 2nd year student
                in University of Toronto St. George campus.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a gamer, but not the hardcore type. I can play most games at decent skill level, but I cannot compete with the
                high-level players in those games. Out of all the games I played, modern Tetris is the game I had most skill in.
                My current record of sprint in (clearing 40 lines) Tetris is 34.358s, which is at the semi-top level. You can check
                my Tetris profile right <a href="https://jstris.jezevec10.com/u/124san">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I used to be a semi-competitive player in Pokemon Trading Card Games (PTCG), and I was quite competent. However, the water
                in the competitive PTCG community is too big, which have my decision of quitting competitive PTCG made.
                I can expand a lot on this point, but that will be off-topic.
            </p>
